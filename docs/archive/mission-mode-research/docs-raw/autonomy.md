# Autonomy Level

Choose Off, Low, Medium, or High to control what Droid can do without repeated confirmations.

Autonomy Level sets the highest-risk work Droid can run without pausing for approval. It is separate from interaction mode: Normal Mode executes work, while Spec Mode plans before implementation.

## Choose a level

Execute commands and MCP tools have a risk level (`low`, `medium`, or `high`). Droid runs them automatically when the risk is at or below your Autonomy Level, unless a denylist or sandbox check requires approval, or the command matches the blocklist. Blocklisted commands never run at any level and have no approval prompt.

| Autonomy Level | What can run without approval                           | Examples                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Off**        | Built-in read tools and allowlisted commands only       | `Read`, `LS`, `ls`, `pwd`, `git status`                                |
| **Low**        | File edits plus low-risk commands and MCP tools         | `Edit`, `Create`, `rg`, showing logs                                   |
| **Medium**     | Everything from Low plus reversible workspace changes   | `npm install`, `pip install`, `git commit`, `mv`, `cp`, build tooling  |
| **High**       | High-risk actions unless safety checks require approval | `docker compose up`, `git push` if allowed, migrations, custom scripts |

Droid still streams output and highlights file changes at every level.

## How approvals work

Autonomy Level controls automatic approval, not which tools are available. Tool policy, MCP configuration, model support, and organization controls can still restrict tools.

{/* sweep-allow: term-bullets */}

- **Normal vs. Spec Mode**: In Normal Mode, Autonomy Level controls approvals. Spec Mode is read-only planning; after approval, Droid exits Spec Mode and returns to Normal Mode for implementation.
- **File changes**: Low or higher lets Droid create, edit, and patch files without asking first.
- **Commands and MCP tools**: Droid compares the tool risk level to your Autonomy Level. If the risk is higher, it asks before continuing.
- **Allowlisted commands**: Commands in the allowlist can run without approval unless they also match the denylist or blocklist.
- **Safety checks**: Denylisted dangerous commands still ask at High, including dangerous commands nested inside `$(...)` or backticks. Blocklisted commands are rejected outright at every level, with no approval prompt. [Sandbox](/autonomy-and-safety/sandbox) read, write, and network checks can also prompt separately.
- **Allow always**: Choosing an "always allow" option raises the current Autonomy Level to the level required by that prompt. Sandbox "allow always" options instead persist the allowed path or domain.
- **Spec approval**: When approving a Spec Mode plan, choose **Proceed with implementation** to continue with manual approvals, or choose an available Low, Medium, or High option for implementation. Organization Maximum Autonomy Level can hide higher options.

## Command allowlists, denylists, and blocklists

Use `commandAllowlist`, `commandDenylist`, and `commandBlocklist` in [Settings](/droid-cli/settings) to encode command policy for your user profile, a project, a local project override, or a nested folder.

- Allowlist entries are treated as low-risk for the matching scope.
- Denylist entries always take precedence over allowlist entries. A denied command still runs if you explicitly approve it.
- Blocklist entries can never run: there is no approval prompt, and the block holds even under full autonomy, auto-run, or `--skip-permissions-unsafe`. Use it for commands that must be hard-stopped regardless of approvals.
- Commands not covered by any list fall back to the active Autonomy Level and command restrictions.
- Organization-managed settings have the highest priority. Local and project settings can add defaults for a repo or machine, but they cannot weaken organization command policy or raise autonomy above the organization maximum. See [Enterprise Controls & Managed Settings](/enterprise/hierarchical-settings-and-org-control).

The built-in denylist covers common destructive patterns such as filesystem wipes, disk formatting, shutdown commands, fork bombs, and broad permission or ownership changes. Add project-specific commands when your repo has additional dangerous scripts or deployment paths.

<Warning>
  Because the blocklist cannot be bypassed by approval, it is the strongest control available. droid resolves the actual program being invoked before matching, so a blocked command cannot be slipped through with a wrapper shell (for example `bash -c "…"`), an absolute path, quoting tricks, or command substitution.
</Warning>

## Change the level

- Press <Kbd keys='Ctrl+L' /> to cycle `Off → Low → Medium → High → Off`. Organization policy can cap the highest available level.
- Press <Kbd keys='Shift+Tab' /> to switch between Normal Mode and Spec Mode.
- Set a default in `/settings` for future sessions.
- Change Autonomy Level before implementation, from the [Spec Mode](/autonomy-and-safety/specification-mode) approval dialog, or any time after leaving Spec Mode.

## Where Autonomy Level applies

{/* sweep-allow: term-bullets */}

- **Interactive CLI**: `droid` uses the session's current Autonomy Level. `droid "<prompt>"` starts the same interactive CLI with an initial prompt, so the first task uses your configured default. See the [CLI reference](/droid-cli/cli-reference).
- **Factory App**: Factory App sessions use the same Normal, Spec, Mission, and Autonomy Level controls as CLI sessions.
- **Droid Exec**: `droid exec` is read-only by default. Use `--auto low`, `--auto medium`, or `--auto high` for non-interactive runs that need edits, local development commands, or broader automation. See [Droid Exec](/droid-exec/overview).
- **Custom Droids (Subagents)**: Task-launched subagents inherit the parent session's Autonomy Level by default, or use the **Subagent autonomy level** setting (`inherit`, `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`) when configured, always clamped to the organization's Maximum Autonomy Level. In Spec Mode they are read-only. Organization and Droid tool policy can still restrict them. See [Custom Droids](/harness/subagents).
- **Factory Missions**: Missions orchestration requires High autonomy or `--skip-permissions-unsafe` (unsafe: skips all permission checks; use only in isolated sandboxes), and admins can restrict who can start Missions. See [Factory Missions](/missions/overview).

## Enterprise Controls

Enterprise admins can set organization-wide autonomy boundaries with organization-managed settings. See [Enterprise Controls & Managed Settings](/enterprise/hierarchical-settings-and-org-control).

- **Default Autonomy Level** sets the starting level for new sessions.
- **Maximum Autonomy Level** caps how high members can raise autonomy. If the maximum is Medium, High is unavailable in the CLI.

These controls layer with command allowlists, command denylists, MCP restrictions, sandbox settings, and Missions access controls.

## Use it safely

- Start new or high-stakes work with Off or Low until you trust the plan.
- Match the minimum level to the work: use Low for file edits and generated reports, Medium when the run must install dependencies, build, test, or make local commits, and High for pushes, deployments, Task-launched subagents, Missions, or other orchestration.
- Add defense in depth with [blocking hooks](/harness/hooks), command denylists, MCP restrictions, least-privilege credentials, and isolated runners.
- For CI workflows, choose the lowest `droid exec --auto` level that allows the workflow to complete. See [Automated Code Review](/software-factory/code-review-ci) and [Droid Exec](/droid-exec/overview).
- If you spot a suspect command, interrupt, provide guidance, and resume at the Autonomy Level that fits the remaining risk.
